"""Prompt injection detection test suite.

This module provides a data-driven test framework for evaluating prompt injection
detection capabilities. Test cases are defined in YAML files under payloads/,
making it easy for contributors to add new test vectors without writing Python code.

See payloads/README.md for the payload schema and contribution guidelines.
